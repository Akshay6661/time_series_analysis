The project focuses on gathering stock data, preprocessing it, checking stationarity, fitting the ARIMA model, making predictions, and evaluating the model’s performance.



Output:
Prediction Graph: A plot showing the actual stock prices and the forecasted stock prices for the next 30 days.
RMSE Score: The calculated RMSE value for the model’s performance.
